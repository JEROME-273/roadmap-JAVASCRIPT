# Week 3: Control Flow & Decision Making

## Overview

Now that you can work with variables and functions, it's time to make your programs smart! This week you'll learn how to make decisions in code and repeat actions efficiently.

## What You'll Learn

- Making decisions with if/else statements
- Using comparison and logical operators
- Switch statements for multiple conditions
- For loops and while loops
- Breaking down complex logic

## Daily Structure

### Day 1: If/Else Statements

**File**: `day1-conditionals.js`

- Simple if statements
- If/else statements
- Else if chains
- Nested conditionals

### Day 2: Comparison & Logical Operators

**File**: `day2-operators.js`

- Comparison operators (>, <, ===, !==)
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Combining conditions
- Truthy and falsy values

### Day 3: For Loops

**File**: `day3-for-loops.js`

- Basic for loop syntax
- Looping through numbers
- Loop with arrays
- Nested loops

### Day 4: While Loops & Break/Continue

**File**: `day4-while-loops.js`

- While loops
- Do-while loops
- Break and continue statements
- When to use each type of loop

### Day 5: Switch Statements

**File**: `day5-switch.js`

- Switch statement syntax
- Multiple cases
- Default case
- When to use switch vs if/else

## Week 3 Project: Number Guessing Game
