# Week 4: Arrays & Objects - Working with Data

## Overview

This week you'll master the two most important data structures in JavaScript: Arrays and Objects. You'll learn to store, manipulate, and transform data efficiently.

## What You'll Learn

- Advanced array operations
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach)
- Creating and using objects
- Object properties and methods
- Combining arrays and objects
- Real-world data manipulation
