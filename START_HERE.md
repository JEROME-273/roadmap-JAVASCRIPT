# Quick Start Guide: Your First 30 Minutes

## Right Now (5 minutes)

1. Open the `exercises/week1/day1-variables.js` file
2. Read through the comments (the gray text starting with //)
3. Don't worry about understanding everything yet

## Next 15 minutes: Your First Code

1. **Uncomment the first TODO**: Remove the `//` from the beginning of the line
2. **Fill in your information**: Replace the placeholder text
3. **Run the code**:
   - Open terminal in VS Code (View → Terminal)
   - Type: `node exercises/week1/day1-variables.js`
   - Press Enter

## Final 10 minutes: Experiment

1. Change your name to something else and run again
2. Try different numbers for your age
3. Add a new variable for your favorite food

## What You Just Did

✅ You wrote JavaScript code
✅ You executed a program
✅ You saw the output
✅ You experimented with changes

**Congratulations! You're officially coding!** 🎉

## Tomorrow (Day 2)

Open `day2-functions.js` and repeat the process. Each day builds on the previous day.

## If You Get Stuck

1. Read the error message carefully
2. Check for typos
3. Make sure you saved the file
4. Ask for help - that's how all developers learn!

## The Most Important Thing

**Write code every day, even if it's just 10 minutes.** Consistency beats intensity in programming.
